- [ ] Open Dev Tools (`F12`) in Chrome/Edge and reload your site.

- [ ] Check in Google Analytics that user events are being tracked (e.g. the active user count shows you browsing the site).  It may take a minute or two for Google Analytics to start showing events, so be patient.

- [ ] Once you're happy Partytown is working correctly, you can set the `assign partytown_use_debug_mode` to `false` in the `theme.liquid` file for performance benefits.
- [ ] You can benchmark the difference Partytown makes by toggling the `assign partytown_use_partytown` setting on and off in the `theme.liquid` file, and then running Google PageSpeed Insights: https://pagespeed.web.dev/ 
  - Remember to set `assign partytown_use_debug_mode` to `false` as well to get the best performance
  - Note: PageSpeed Insights will only work with public sites, not with password protected sites
  - To evaluate password protected sites, use the Lighthouse report option in Dev Tools (`F12`) instead.
